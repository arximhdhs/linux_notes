Bash looks at folder declared in the PATH variable,
so if you haven't include our file in any of these folder
we have to specifically tell the bash where to find this script.
We can use an absolute path or a relative path.
So if we want to run a script at the folder we are in we simply type
/bin/bash: :wq: command not found
~                                                                               
~
